# File-comparison

Compare two files without worring about comparing the two hashes.
The program will show to you a GREEN pic if the two file are equals and RED if didn't.

Update: for the colorblind people, there's a "Colorblind" menu which if activated, will
	change the default color to BLUE color if the two files matches and BLACK if didn't.

When files are the same, the status bar will prompt the MD5.
